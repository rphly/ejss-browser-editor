EJSS Browser Editor

The ejss-browser-editor is a browser-based code editor designed to work with the Easy JavaScript Simulations (EJSS) authoring toolkit. The EJSS authoring toolkit is a software package for creating computer simulations of physical systems that can be used for educational purposes. The ejss-browser-editor makes it easier to create, edit, and preview EJSS simulations by providing a web-based interface for editing EJSS code.
With the ejss-browser-editor, users can edit existing EJSS simulations. The editor provides input fields and a simple function for more complex usage. Users can preview their simulations only after "saving" the model, decoupling initial variables view from simulation, simplify the process of user editable simulation.
The ejss-browser-editor is built using the ReactJS that provides many advanced features for code editing.
Overall, the ejss-browser-editor makes it easier for educators and students to modify EJS simulations, without the need for a separate code editor or programming environment.

What are the server requirements to run this project
.....?? please add on


Prototype deployment
https://ejss-browser-editor-web.onrender.com/ 
https://ejss-browser-editor.herokuapp.com/ died

Documentation use by teachers
https://iwant2study.org/ospsg/index.php/related-sites/959-ejss-sim-web-editor-by-raphael-yee


What the file look for ?
in the Variable the tab must be name EditableVariable
in the custom function tab , must be name EditableFunction
it only searches files in this location https://iwant2study.org/lookangejss/EditableSimulations/
else if not, you must use EJSS editor/toolkit to edit the tab yourself before uploading here https://ejss-browser-editor.herokuapp.com/ for the editableVariable to be pass on to be editable.
